Dosewise: AI-Powered Medical Document Parser
Dosewise is a specialized medical document parsing application designed for the IAR Udaan Hackathon 2026. It leverages advanced AI models to accurately extract, translate, and explain medical prescriptions and reports for patients.

🚀 How It Works
1. Document Upload & Pre-processing
Input: Users can upload medical documents as images (PNG, JPEG) or PDFs, or manually enter prescription text.
Conversion: On the frontend, uploaded files are converted into high-resolution base64 data to ensure maximum clarity for the AI model.
Secure Transfer: The data is sent via a secure Express.js backend to the Gemini API.
2. AI-Powered Parsing (Gemini 3 Flash)
Dosewise uses the Gemini 3 Flash Preview model for its core parsing logic. This model is chosen for its high-speed reasoning and exceptional ability to understand complex, handwritten medical documents.

System Prompting: A specialized medical prompt instructs the model to extract data with 100% verbatim accuracy for medication dosages.
Handwriting Recognition: The model uses its internal medical knowledge and context (like diagnosis) to infer difficult-to-read handwriting.
Verification: Every extracted medication is cross-referenced with medical databases to flag unverified or uncertain names.
JSON Output: The model returns a structured JSON object containing:
Diagnosis (in simple terms)
Medication list (name, dosage, frequency, duration, purpose)
Simplified patient instructions (e.g., "twice a day" instead of "bid")
Potential side effects and their severity
Follow-up reminders and general health notes
3. Multi-Language Support (Hindi & English)
Real-time Translation: The model can translate the entire analysis into Hindi while keeping medication names in English for safety and clarity.
Cultural Nuances: It uses correct Hindi punctuation (।) and formal, warm language suitable for medical contexts.
4. AI Voice Explanation (Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS)
Dosewise provides an accessible "Voice Explanation" feature using the Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview TTS model.

Script Generation: A custom script is generated based on the analysis results.
Natural Speech: The model generates warm, natural-sounding audio in the user's chosen language (English or Hindi).
Streaming Playback: Audio is fetched and played sentence-by-sentence for a responsive user experience.
5. Export & Accessibility
PDF Download: Users can generate a high-quality PDF summary of their analysis using html2canvas and jsPDF.
Print Ready: The dashboard is optimized for printing, allowing users to keep physical copies of their simplified medical summaries.
